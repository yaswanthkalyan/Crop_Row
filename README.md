# Crop_Row
Detecting the crop rows using Link net
I am uploading my source code and as the dataset is private I cannot upload the dataset for downloading.
I have used 5 convolutional layers for encoding and 4 deconvolutional layers for decoding in the architecture.
Please feel free to suggest any changes that can improve the results.
